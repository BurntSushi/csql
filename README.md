Package csql provides convenience functions for use with the types and 
functions defined in the standard library `database/sql` package.


### Installation

If you have Go installed and
[your GOPATH is setup](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), then 
`csql` can be installed with `go get`:

    go get github.com/BurntSushi/csql


### Documentation

Documentation is available at
[godoc.org/github.com/BurntSushi/csql](http://godoc.org/github.com/BurntSushi/csql).


### Unstable

At the moment, I'm still experimenting with the public API, so I may still 
introduce breaking changes.
